% Isi Abstrak
The final project proposal titled "Electric Wheelchair Control System Using Touchpad Based on Raspberry Pi" explores the development of a touchpad-based control system for electric wheelchairs using Raspberry Pi. This research aims to improve the ease of operation for users with special needs, making it simpler for them to navigate electric wheelchairs. The proposed system seeks to replace the conventional joystick control with a touchpad system, expected to enhance navigation, safety, and comfort for wheelchair users. The study focuses on integrating touchpad technology with wheelchair control, emphasizing the potential to increase user independence and the commercial viability of related industries.
